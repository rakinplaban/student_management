This Application is a console-based java project. Some OOP concepts ware applied in this code.
This consists of 2 type of stack holders: 
1. Admin
2. Teacher

Students are not stack holders. Their data are being stored in a file. Mainly admin will do the job.
Admin will add new students, remove or update existing students. Even teacher's account will be created by
the admin.

The only task that teachers will perform is to view students' data only. That is, students' data is read only
for teachers.

This is the overview of the project.
